# e-MART
E-mart is a website designed to provide unemployed workers  with the aim of providing employment to our society. Lack of unemployment  and a lack of labour will hinder the growth of society. Here, the e-mart website  makes a clear solution. Thus, e-mart is becoming indirectly contributing to the  progress of the society due to the lack of employment and the workers who do  not have the workers.

Till now, all details of contractor, sub-contractor and work order allotment are done manually 
and on paper. It becomes very difficult to get all the details about any contractor in a short 
time. A lot of time, money and energy is wasted in searching as well as maintaining the 
documents. Many times, contractors were not intimated on time about their license which 
was going to expire. The present Labour Management System does not follow any proper 
channel making the whole system redundant and ambiguous.
The main objective of this Labour Management System project is to have a completely 
automated project allotment system which can even be managed by a non-technical person. 
This project will serve the purpose of maintaining all the contractor and sub-contractor details 
This Labour Management System project will definitely reduce the time and effort in 
searching for contractors. Fetching all the contractor details, sub-contractor details and work 
order details will be made easy with just a single mouse click. Overall management of 
Contract labor will be easy and quick.
The proposed Labour Management System will the precious time, money, energy and paper 
with flawless execution. Each and every process, be it addition of a new contractor, allotting 
project all will be digitized. Manual searching will be reduced as all contractor details can be 
listed along with their expiration dates and can be imported to excel sheets.
